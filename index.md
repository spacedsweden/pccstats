# PCC Stats Winter League 2025 - Week 1

## Introduction

First of all, thank you for joining us! We are thrilled to see the league growing and hope you are enjoying it as much as we are. We are seeing good growth in the number of players, and we are very happy about that. We hope you are enjoying the league as much as we do.

We would like to remind you that the league is open to everyone. If you have friends who would like to join, please invite them to our Discord server.

With our growing numbers, we have experienced some challenges with wait times between games, both last season and this season. These wait times are both real and perceived by players. With this document, I want to explain the data and some of the nuances that come into play when adjusting league parameters.

## How Long is Too Long?

The first thing we need to establish is what constitutes a long wait time. This is a very subjective question, and the answer varies from person to person. However, we have a few data points that can help establish a baseline. PCC has always been a club that plays in a bar setting, focusing on both having a great time with friends and playing cornhole. Additionally, we get the venue for free due to the food and drinks being purchased. So remember, peeps, tip your bartenders! Now, let's dig into the data, starting with the B1 division.

### How Long Should It Take According to Scoreholio?

Based on the number of boards available, below is the expected time to complete the night according to Scoreholio for PCC. This assumes a static number of boards throughout the night and incorporates our known average game time plus warm-up time in the club.

#### All Indoors

| Division | Teams | Boards | Time to Complete | Game Duration (Excl. Warmup) | Average Wait Between Games (Incl. Warmup) | Expected Finish Time |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ---------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| B1       | 17    | 4      | 3h 36m           | 17 min                       | 19 min                                 | 21:36              |
| B2       | 8     | 2      | 3h 24m           | 17 min                       | 19 min                                 | 21:24              |
| A        | 10    | 2      | 4h 15m           | 17 min                       | 27 min                                 | 22:15              |
| C        | 20    | 2      | 4h 15m           | 17 min                       | 27 min                                 | 22:15              |

On Thursdays, we need to complete 75 games. This requires 12.5 games per board, with each game taking about 17 minutes. That’s 12.5 games per board at 17 minutes per game. Even if every player was on the board on time with no warm-up, it would still take the same amount of time. In fact, if there were only one division, it would take longer. Realistically, time spent getting to the court and transitioning between matches is part of the game. When comparing our stats globally, we are slightly slower than other clubs—only by about 30 seconds for both warm-up and match duration.

### What Affects Speed of Play?

Several factors impact the time between games:

1. Number of teams per board ratio
2. Match duration
3. How quickly players start a game after a board becomes available

One additional factor that affects total event duration (but not necessarily wait time between games) is the number of rounds.

### Staggered Starts: Do They Help?

Staggered starts can help align division end times, but they also introduce new challenges.
Staggered starts can help ensure that different divisions finish around the same time. Historically, we have used staggered starts with divisions A and C, where the largest division starts earlier and the smaller division starts later. While this method helps synchronize division end times, it also increases wait times for larger divisions at the start of the night and for smaller divisions at the end of the night. However, for most of the night, wait durations align with Scoreholio's estimates.

If complaints arise about excessive wait times, staggered starts are not a viable solution unless the smaller division starts at full capacity while delaying the larger division’s start until the smaller division has mostly finished. Below is an example of how staggered starts affect wait times:

| Division | Time  | Boards | Games Played | Wait Time |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ------------ | --------- |
| C        | 18:00 | 6      | 20/60        | 11 min    |
| C        | 19:00 | 4      | 33/60        | 27 min    |
| A        | 19:00 | 2      | 7/30         | 27 min    |
| C        | 20:00 | 4      | 46/60        | 27 min    |
| A        | 20:00 | 2      | 14/30        | 27 min    |
| C        | 21:00 | 4      | 60/60        | 27 min    |
| A        | 21:00 | 3      | 24/30        | 12 min    |
| A        | 22:00 | 4      | 30/30        | 12 min    |

As seen above, staggered starts only improve wait times at the very beginning and very end of the night. The only way to make staggered times work is to start the smaller division first, significantly delaying its start time. This approach would also diminish the league’s social aspect, which many players appreciate.

For these reasons, we will **not** implement staggered starts solely to address wait times.

### Reality Check - Week 1

| Division | Start  | Finish  | Longest Time to Board | Avg. Time to Board | Longest Game | Avg. Game | Max Wait Time | Avg. Wait Time |
| -------- | ------ | ------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| B1       | 18:09  | 21:49   | 11:14               | 04:31            | 25:45        | 12:40     | 45:53        | 16:36         |
| B2       | 18:09  | 21:36   | 07:35               | 03:30            | 21:21        | 12:01     | 45:27        | 18:24         |
| A        | 18:32  | 22:01   | N/A                 | N/A              | N/A          | N/A       | N/A          | N/A           |
| C        | 18:04  | 22:24   | 08:01               | 03:22            | 26:25        | 13:04     | 55:40        | 24:16         |

The division that suffered the most was **C**, with an average wait time of 24 minutes and a max wait time of 55 minutes. This is unacceptable, and we will take measures to prevent this from happening again.

### Conclusion & Solution

The solution for both Wednesday and Thursday is **more boards** and keeping the number of boards consistent throughout the night. Switching the number of boards mid-event disrupts matchups and increases wait times.

Here are the expected completion times with outside boards, explaining how they improve wait times.

| Division | Teams | Boards | Time to Complete | Game Duration (Excl. Warmup) | Average Wait Between Games (Incl. Warmup) | Expected Finish Time |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ---------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| B1       | 17    | 5      | 2h 53m           | 17 min                       | 12 min                                 | 20:53              |
| B2       | 8     | 3      | 2h 16m           | 17 min                       | 6 min                                  | 20:16              |
| A        | 10    | 3      | 2h 50m           | 17 min                       | 11 min                                 | 22:15              |
| C        | 20    | 5      | 3h 24m           | 17 min                       | 17 min                                 | 21:24              |

We appreciate your patience and support as we optimize the league experience. See you on the boards!
