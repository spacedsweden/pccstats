# PCC stats Winter league 2025 Week 1

## Introduction
First of all thank you all for playing with us, we are seeing a good growth in the number of players and we are very happy with that. We hope you are enjoying the league as much as we do.

We would like to remind you that the league is open to everyone, if you have friends that would like to join, please invite them to our discord server.

Due to the growth we last season and this season both have a little bit of problems with wait times between games, both real but also percieved by the players. With this document I want to explain and show you the data and explain some of the nuances of what happens when you change parameters in the league.

## How long is long?
The first thing we need to establish is what is a long wait time. This is a very subjective question and the answer will vary from person to person. We have a few data points that we can use to establish a baseline. PCC has always been a club that plays in a bar setting that focus on a good time hanging out with your friends AND play cornhole, as a plus we get the venue for free because of the drinks and food that are being sold. So remember peeps, tip your bartenders. But lets start digging in to the data and start with B1 division.

### How long shold it take according to scoreholio?
Given the number of boards we have below is the expected time it should take to play the night according to Scoreholio for PCC, since we do know average game time + warmup time in the club.
This assumes a static number of boards during the whole night.

#### All indoors

| Division | Teams | Boards | Time to complete | Game duration (ex warmup)| Average wait between games (inc warmup)|Expected finish time|
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ---------------- |-------| ------------ |--|
| B1       | 17    | 4      | 3h 36m           |17|19              |21:36|
| B2       | 8     | 2      | 3h 24m           |17|19              |21:24|
| A        | 10    | 2      | 4h 15m           |17|27              |10:15|
| C        | 20    | 2      | 4h 15m           |17|27             |10:15|

To put in a another way on thursdays we need to complete 75 games, thats 12.5 games per board a 17 min IF you where all on the board on time no warmup etc. it would still the same amoubnt of time, in fact if it was only one division it would take longer. Thats not a realistic hope, time to get to court, down and back is part of the game. When you look at global stats we are somewhat slower than other clubs, but only by 30 seconds both on warmup and on match duration.

### What affects speed of play?

There is a few factors,  that impacts time between games.

1. Number of teams/board ratio
2. Match duration
3. How fast a game starts after the board is ready for you

The last factor that determines how long it will take to finish your night, but not as much impact on the duration between games are the number of rounds.

### What about staggered starts?

Staggered starts can be useful to finish the night at the same time for two division, historically thats what we done with A/C the biggest division starts a bit earlier and the smaller division starts a bit later. This is a good way to make sure that the night ends at the same time for everyone. It does impact the wait time between games for larger division at the start of the night, and the smaller at the end of the night. But the majority of the time the wait duration is in line with Scoreholio's estimate. So when the complaint is that the time between games is too long, staggered starts is not the solution unless you start the night with the smaller division at maximum boards, and delay the start of the larger division until the smaller division is done or almost done.

Example:

| Division | Time  | Boards | Games played | Wait time |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ------------ | --------- |
| C        | 18:00 | 6      | 20/60        | 11min     |
| C        | 19:00 | 4      | 33/60        | 27min     |
| A        | 19:00 | 2      | 7/30         | 27min     |
| C        | 20:00 | 4      | 46/60        | 27min     |
| A        | 20:00 | 2      | 14/30        | 27min     |
| C        | 21:00 | 4      | 60/60        | 27min     |
| A        | 21:00 | 3      | 24/30        | 12min     |
| A        | 22:00 | 4      | 30/30        | 12min     |

So as you can see, it improves only at very beginning and very end of the night.

The only way staggered times would work is if switched to start the smaller division first with teh effect that it would push the start time for the smaller division way later, and as many of the players appreciate take away the social aspect of the league with cross division hanging out. It also have a negative effect on on the larger division since it was flying through the games at the start of the night. and then come to complete stop is the feeling.
We as organizers would have to really push the division that starts to get to the board fast to finish before the others come, and boards only help that much. A can only use 5 boards and B2 can only use 4 boards.

| Division | Time  | Boards | Games played | Wait time |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ------------ | --------- |
| A        | 18:00 | 4      | 17/30        | 0min     |
| A        | 19:40 | 4      | 30/30        | 0min     |
| C        | 20:00 | 6      | 20/60        | 11min     |
| C        | 21:00 | 6      | 40/60        | 11min     |
| C        | 22:00 | 6      | 60/60        | 11min     |

So that would mean C (B2) would end their night in best conditions at 23:00 and A at 20:00.
This is also not a guarantee, cause a couple of long games especially in the beginning of the night for the smaller division throws both match-ups and wait times off. So it becomes vary volatile solution.

> This is why we will not do staggered starts as a solution to the problem of long wait times between games. We may for other reasons.

But wait, thursdays have done it before? That is true, the only effect it has is to give Tim a little bit peace of mind to get C started and speed it up a little bit at the end of the night for A, it have no effect on the wait time between games for the majority of the night. C is record big this season with 3 more teams than last season, it has a big effect.


### Unwanted side effects with staggered starts and switching number for boards during a night.

In short, dont fuck with scoreholio's magic! When you change parameters especially when its not set schedule you mess with the match-ups, and cause random matchup delays.

## Reality check week 1

|Division|Start	|Finish  |Longest time to board	|Avg to board	|Longest Game	|Avg Game	|Max WaitTime	|Avg WaitTime|
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|------------|
|B1|18:09:23   |21:49:36|11:14                  |04:31          |25:45  |12:40      |45:53          |00:16:36 |
|B2|18:09:51   |21:36:29|7:35                  |03:30          |21:21  |12:01      |45:27          |00:18:24 |
|A|18:32:00   |22:01:00|n/a|n/a|n/a  |n/a      |n/a          |n/a |
|C|18:04:50   |22:24:27|8:01                  |03:22          |26:25  |13:04      |55:40          |00:24:16 |

B1 and B2: So we and Scoreholio where kind of right on the money, we started 10 min late first night of season, Average time to the board, and a Slide Brothers got stuck in some weird loop in the middle of the night with a horrible 45 min wait time.  So this was with running 2 boards out side for 1 hour. We had a setting in Scoreholio on all division that blocked back to back courts that was probably the culprit for Slide Brothers and the team they met (they also waited a long time. )

A finished early, unfortunately there is no data in scoreholio for match duration warmup times when its set schedule so we cant see wait times, however we do know one team got stuck in a long wait time, it was because of back to back courts again that puts a match in a loop if you have two boards and they played on different courts previous game. This wont happen again. Even though C started 30 minutes early they still finished last for the evening, due to we took away a board during the evening, we wont do that again. Also C also ran into the a little bit of back to back court problem, but not as bad as A.

Overall getting to the board where a little bit longer than expected, the games where a little bit shorter than expected but overall that made the night for A and C a little bit shorter than expected by scoreholio.

The division that suffered the most was C with an average wait time of 24 minutes, and a max wait time of 55 minutes. This is not acceptable, and we will do everything in our power to make sure this does not happen again.

The other thing we hope we will get rid of with the setting of back to back boards being set is that we will get rid of the 10% of the games that got stuck with wait times over 35 minutes. However if you get stuck over 40 minutes come and see us and we will look in to it. Under 40 it can happend that you will have to wait and get skipped to make matchups work for scoreholio. Especially in the smaller divisions where there is few boards.


Also worth noticing is that wait time are not static for the evening, the longer the evening progress the longer the the time between games get, and it doesnt seem to have anything to do with that you have longer games, whats most likely causing this is that the match-ups are getting harder to make as the evening progress. This is also why we dont want to switch number of boards during the night, it will mess with the matchups and cause longer wait times.

|Time|Avg Game |Avg Time between games|
|----|--------|-----------|
|18  |00:11:16|00:07:54   |
|19  |00:12:43|00:19:10   |
|20  |00:14:06|00:21:21   |
|21  |00:12:41|00:26:10   |
|22  |00:16:12|00:33:03   |

Its also interesting and maybe a proof that divisions work, the average game time is pretty much the same for all divisions and with comparing with global average probably a bit more competitive since they are longer.


## Conclusion/Solution

So what is the solution for both Wednesday and Thursday? Its more boards, and keep it consistent thru the night, not switching number of boards until the very end if one division finishes early.
Also you have to bear in mind that an average is an average, that means you will be up in 5 minutes sometimes and 35 minutes sometimes Scoreholio have it calculated so you  will not meet a team twice in one night.

As we said in signups, we will put two boards outside when weather permits. To not make the night longer we will not promise any back to back games, however if you get your third game up on outside come and see us and we will pause that game and put it on the next available board inside.
A and B2 you we do not recommend to play outside especially B2 that is not schedule, games will be hung up due to no matchups, or we will have to force rematches between same teams. So the expected numbers in the table below based on number of courts wont hold most likely cause wait times to be matched up with a team  you have not played will be longer.

Below is the expected time to complete the night for all with outside boards.


| Division | Teams | Boards | Time to complete | Game duration (ex warmup)| Average wait between games (inc warmup)|Expected finish time|
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ---------------- |-------| ------------ |--|
| B1       | 17    | 5      | 2h 53m           |17|12              |20:53|
| B2       | 8     | 3      | 2h 16m           |17|6              |20:16|
| A        | 10    | 3      | 2h 50m           |17|11              |22:15|
| C        | 20    | 5      | 3h 24m           |17|17             |21:24|

A and B2 will have the option to opt out from playing outside and keep on playing 2 boards inside. That decision can be made at the start of the night, and we will adjust the number of boards accordingly. If they choose to not play otuside, their courts become warmups court for the night.My recommendation is for B2 to not play outside, and A to play outside at least for the 1st hour or so.
